This website is created for the project w IN1010 @ City, University of London. 

It was required to use php and develop an responsive website with registration/login to book an appointment. 

To develop nice looking and responsive website I've used Bootstrap 5 and jQuery.

jQuery was used to provide logged user panel to create an asynchronous content to book a meeting and switch panels (booking history / request a booking) without any need to reload the page.
